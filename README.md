# Automated Detection of  Unstructured Context-dependent Sensitive Information in Unstructured Data Containers

The majority of data loss prevention (DLP) systems focus on detecting data breaches and preventing potential data leaks. However, the data leak is not necessarily the result of a data breach; unintentional or accidental exposure is always possible.With the rapid growth of cloud computing and remote workforce, organizations are increasingly awakened to the risk of data leak and data exfiltration. Handling such risk has become more challenging due to the fact that, today organizations usually deal with big data. In particular, organizations have to deal with a massive amount of unstructured data. As a result, modern DLP solutions must support automated methods to detect and identify confidential and sensitive information in both structured and unstructured data.  In this paper, we investigate the use of machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to automate the detection of context-dependent sensitive information in unstructured data. % We investigated the use of ML and NLP to detect sensitive information in both images and unstructured text. 

In this project We compare 5 approaches on two datasets:
- Extracting Features based on Sensitive Data
- Extracting Features based on Tf-Idf
- Rule-Based approach
- CNN
- RNN
